    name: 'Jerome Palacios Myerson',
    image: '/Jerome.PNG',
    bio: `A native Californian raised in the reform Jewish movement, he has become increasingly aware of the absence of Palestinian history and perspectives during his youth and now gravitates toward safe spaces designed for mutual understanding.

When not advocating for empathy, Jerome enjoys swimming in the ocean, playing with his cat Bongo, and exploring nature with his wife and son.`,
